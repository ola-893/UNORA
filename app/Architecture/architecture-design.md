# Unora — Architecture Design
### Undercollateralized Lending Protocol · Monad Metropolis Hackathon — Track 01 (Onchain Finance & Trading), Hint 3

---

## 0. Product

**Name:** Unora
**Tagline direction:** credit-scored, undercollateralized lending on Monad — trust that's earned, not assumed.

The name and mark carry through the product as the umbrella brand for the pieces already designed in this document: the `ScoreRegistry` soulbound NFT, the `SponsorGraph`, and the `LendingPool`/`StreamManager` are all Unora-branded components of one protocol, not separate products.

---

## 1. System Overview

The product has five functional layers. Each layer maps to a stage in the original pipeline (scan → score → loan → repay → rescoring), with the sponsor/vouching and velocity-cap logic woven into layers 2 and 3 to solve the Sybil/rug-attack gap.

## 2. Backend Architecture

### 2.1 Indexer Layer — "Cross-chain scan"
- **Tool:** Envio (HyperIndex) — indexes the borrower's transaction history across supported chains (Monad + a couple of EVM chains for cross-chain liability detection).
- **What it pulls per wallet:** supply/borrow events, liquidation events, repayment timeliness, wallet age, existing open debt positions on other protocols.
- **Output:** a normalized "wallet activity record" written to a Postgres/ClickHouse store, refreshed on a schedule (cron) and on-demand when a borrower initiates a new loan request.
- **Sponsor bounty fit:** Envio ($1,000 "Best Use of Envio").

### 2.2 Scoring Engine — "Credit score" (with the fix applied)
A service (Node/Python) that computes, per wallet:
1. **Raw behavior score** — repayment history, collateral stability, liquidation count, wallet age. (Standard part, same as Cred Protocol/Spectral style scoring.)
2. **Sponsor graph weight** — pulls the wallet's position in the on-chain SponsorGraph (see 3.4) to see if it has an active sponsor and how much of the sponsor's capacity has been delegated.
3. **Velocity cap** — computes the maximum new loan size this wallet is allowed to request this cycle: `max(prior_proven_loan_size * cap_multiplier, sponsor_delegated_capacity)`. This is the actual fix for the "farm small loans, then default big" attack.
4. **Collateral ratio output** — a number between (e.g.) 20%–80% required collateral, derived from the above three inputs. New/unsponsored wallets land near the top of that range; long-tenured or sponsored wallets land near the bottom. Nobody gets 0%.
- **Nansen AI integration:** used to enrich wallet labels (is this address linked to a known entity, exchange, mixer, etc.) as an extra fraud-risk signal feeding into the raw behavior score.
- **Sponsor bounty fit:** Nansen AI ($5,000), Perpl ("Best Analytics / Risk Tool," $5,000/$3,000).
- **Output:** a signed attestation (score, collateral ratio, loan ceiling, timestamp) ready to be relayed onchain.

### 2.3 Oracle Relay — getting the score onchain
- **Tool:** Chainlink CRE (Compute/Runtime Environment) — runs the scoring computation (or at least verifies/relays it) so the result arriving onchain isn't just "trust our backend blindly." This is the credibility layer judges will care about.
- **Flow:** Scoring Engine computes → CRE workflow validates/signs → result written to `ScoreRegistry` contract via a Chainlink-triggered transaction.
- **Sponsor bounty fit:** Chainlink ($3,000, "Best workflow with CRE").

### 2.4 API Layer
- REST/GraphQL API serving the frontend: wallet score lookup, loan offers, sponsor graph queries, active loan/repayment stream status.
- Auth via wallet signature (SIWE-style), no separate login system needed.

### 2.5 Job Scheduler
- Cron jobs: rescoring after each repayment stream tick, sponsor-capacity recalculation after a default, reserve-pool health checks.

## 3. Onchain Contract Architecture (Monad)

### 3.1 `ScoreRegistry` (Soulbound NFT)
- One non-transferable NFT per wallet.
- Stores: current score, current collateral-ratio tier, loan ceiling, sponsor address (if any), list of wallets this address has sponsored.
- Updated only by the Chainlink CRE relay (access-controlled).

### 3.2 `LendingPool` (tranche pool)
- Lenders deposit into tranches (e.g., senior/junior) — standard pooled-liquidity pattern, same shape as Aave/Goldfinch.
- On a borrow request: reads `ScoreRegistry` for the wallet's collateral ratio + loan ceiling, requires the borrower to lock that percentage in collateral, then releases the loan.
- Interest rate is tiered by score (worse score → higher rate, feeds the tranche yield).

### 3.3 `StreamManager` (repayment stream)
- Handles the continuous micro-payment repayment (Sablier-style token streaming, or a simplified custom stream contract).
- On each successful stream tick, emits an event the backend picks up to update the score positively.
- If a stream stalls/stops (missed payment), emits a default-flag event immediately — this is what makes early-detection real, rather than waiting for a lump-sum due date.

### 3.4 `SponsorGraph`
- Tracks vouching relationships: sponsor address → delegated capacity → sponsored wallet.
- On sponsored-wallet default: automatically slashes the sponsor's own available capacity (and optionally a staked bond) proportional to the loss. This is the contract-level enforcement of "your friend's trust is now on the line."
- Exposes a `getEffectiveCeiling(wallet)` view function the scoring engine and LendingPool both call.

### 3.5 `ReservePool`
- A cut of each repayment stream flows here as a default buffer.
- Pays out to the tranche pool's senior lenders first in the event of a shortfall, protecting the most risk-averse capital.

## 4. Frontend Architecture

### 4.1 Stack
- React + wagmi/viem for wallet connection and contract reads/writes.
- Dynamic or Privy for wallet onboarding/embedded wallets (both are sponsor bounties: Dynamic $5,000, Privy $5,000) — lets non-crypto-native users onboard without needing a seed phrase already in their pocket.

### 4.2 Key Screens
1. **Dashboard** — shows the user's current score, soulbound NFT, current collateral tier, loan ceiling, and sponsor relationships (who they've sponsored / who sponsors them).
2. **Borrow flow** — request a loan → see calculated collateral requirement live (driven by the scoring engine's output) → lock collateral → receive funds → see the live repayment-stream progress bar.
3. **Lend flow** — deposit into a tranche, see projected yield by tranche risk tier, see pool utilization and reserve health.
4. **Sponsor flow** — a distinctive feature screen: a user with proven history can browse/invite a new wallet to sponsor, see exactly how much of their own capacity they're delegating, and see real-time exposure if the sponsored wallet is underperforming.
5. **Transparency/graph view** — a visual (force-directed graph) of the sponsor network, good for a hackathon demo — literally shows judges "here's how Sybil resistance works" without words.

### 4.3 Data flow example — a new user requesting a loan
1. Frontend requests wallet's current score/ceiling from the API (backed by the last CRE-relayed onchain value).
2. If no sponsor and thin history → API returns a low ceiling + high collateral ratio.
3. User either (a) accepts the smaller loan, or (b) taps "find a sponsor" → routes to Sponsor flow.
4. Once sponsored, frontend re-queries `SponsorGraph.getEffectiveCeiling()` → shows updated, larger available loan.
5. Loan executes on `LendingPool`, stream begins on `StreamManager`, dashboard updates live via event subscriptions (Envio-indexed events, polled or via websocket).

---

## 5. Why this architecture directly answers the judges' likely objections
- **"How do you stop Sybil wallets?"** → Velocity cap + sponsor-capacity-slashing, enforced onchain in `SponsorGraph`, not just a backend heuristic.
- **"Isn't this just a scoring API with extra steps?"** → The score is relayed via Chainlink CRE, not blindly trusted from a backend — verifiable computation, not a black box.
- **"What actually happens on default?"** → Concrete: stream stalls → default flag → reserve pool absorbs shortfall → sponsor capacity slashed → score updated. Every step has a contract and an event.
- **"Is this really undercollateralized, or just marketing?"** → Yes, genuinely: collateral ratio is always < 100%, scaled from a wide range (near-full for new wallets) down to a low range (proven/sponsored wallets), never fixed at zero and never fixed at a single number for everyone.

## 6. Sponsor SDK / Bounty Map (for reference)
| Layer | Sponsor tool | Bounty |
|---|---|---|
| Indexing | Envio | $1,000 |
| Wallet analytics | Nansen AI | $5,000 |
| Oracle/compute | Chainlink CRE | $3,000 |
| Risk/analytics tool | Perpl | $5,000 / $3,000 |
| Wallet onboarding | Dynamic or Privy | $5,000 each |

This is not exhaustive — worth checking the full sponsor list on the platform once you're inside the hackathon portal, since a couple of others (Alchemy, Zerion) could slot into the indexing/API layer too.
